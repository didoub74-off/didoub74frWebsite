# Personnal Website
Is there any reason for me to tell what is this project ?

### Goal
Finally create my real personal website on which I can show every project I have done (this also allow me to keep them
instead of throwing them away once they are done lol)

### How did I complete it ?
Took a bit of time but was funny though, having the possibility to use both my favorite color (blue and orange) is good
for productivity - I'm talking about the liberty not about those specific color btw.

### Use of AI ?
Never, this tool is prohibited for me, no way to use an AI for a project as simple as this.

### N.B.
If you liked the project it's still nice to star the repo, and feel free to rob my code for you own project.
